many packages/tests would works also in plain, but most tests are done only with latex

luatex obsolete? (01.11.2018, docu changed, no luacolor)
thepdfnumber -> expl3
magicnum?

listingsutf8: test3-5 empty

kvsetkeys-test3: removed (undefines \unexpanded)

intcalc: everything in expl3?
intcalc-test3: removed, undefines \numexpr

pdfrender: interesting,
           luatex85?
           luatex \pdfmatch?

bitset: candidate for expl3? (useful for pdf)
bitset-test3 removed: undefines etex commands (and fails on \ifcsname)

pdfescape -> see l3str-convert, lua code??
 pdfescape-test4 removed (without etex test)
 pdfescape-test6: luatex errors because of missing catcode table, should work when pdftexcmds is updated.

bigintcalc: expl3??
bigintcalc-test3 removed (no etex)



grfext -> graphicx??

iflang -> babel??
iflang-test4 removed (etex)
iflang-test5 removed (vanilla tex)

grffile real test files needed??

% forced pdfoutput=0 for these tests:
pdflscape-test3: test with driver dvipdfm
pdflscape-test4: test with driver dvipsone
pdfcol-test2

Failures:
=========
luatex test4 fails (allocation number wrong)

catcode issues:
 pdfcol-test1: invalid char
 atbegshi-test1: catcode issues?
 resizegather-test1: lualatex fails because of _ in luatex.def

zref-test-runs: looks simply wrong, \ExpectRuns is not defined.

Unclear:
========
atbegshi-test3: "test skipped" because of undefined @EveryShipout@Init
hologo-test-list: 60 pages of logo. Not really possible to get log or pdf test from it.
luacolor-test2: has probably been used with some \def\driver{...} call.
                But doesn't work anymore with luatex due to \pdfoutput




@UlrikeFischer the hycolor ones are all spaces before ( the
selinput ones are because I have a newer utf8enc.dfu it's tempting
to add some \OMIT\TIMO but as the test is testing encoding switches
it's not so clear what can be omitted) and the pdf ones seem to
have different timezone information, are we missing some of the
EPOCH setting flags?
